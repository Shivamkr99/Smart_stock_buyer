In today's fast-paced stock market, making informed investment decisions is crucial. With Smart Stock, I leveraged UiPath Studio to build an automation that helps users evaluate their stock investments effortlessly.
This project, built in UiPath Studio, allows users to enter a budget and select a stock name they wish to invest in. 📊💵 With a simple workflow that leverages web scraping and data collection from real-time sources
✨ How it works?
🔹 Users enter their budget and the stock name they wish to analyze.
🔹 The automation performs a web search & data scraping to fetch key stock metrics:
✅ Stock Price
✅ P/E Ratio
✅ Debt-to-Equity Ratio
✅ Return on Equity (ROE%)
🔹 Based on these insights, the workflow provides a recommendation:
💰 Good Investment – If the stock has strong financials.
⚠️ Risky Investment – If the stock shows red flags.

This project showcases the power of RPA in financial decision-making, reducing manual research time and providing quick, data-driven insights! 🚀
